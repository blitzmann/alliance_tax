Edit apiDetails-sample.ini to include the API details of a -Director- or higher. 
Save it somewhere that IS NOT in your web root, or otherwise inaccessible to 
someone that shouldn't know such details (via .htaccess, UNIX permissions, etc.)

After that, edit config.ini to reflect your corp parameters and the path to the 
protected API file. It's more or less self-explainatory.

Have fun!
